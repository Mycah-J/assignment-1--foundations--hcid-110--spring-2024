  <h1>Hi, I'm Mycah!</h1>
  <img src="img/self-portrait.jpg" alt="Photo Unavailable">
  <p>I am a 24-year-old student at the University of Hartford! I major in Business Analytics and Managerial Economics. <br>
    I am from West Hartford, Connecticut. My goal post-graduation is to pursue a Masters degree in Data Science or Fashion Analytics, ideally somewhere abroad. I have held 3 internships that have built upon my under-graduate knowledge and participated in a start-up focused on UI design and user-centric digital solutions. Feel free to contact me to learn more.
